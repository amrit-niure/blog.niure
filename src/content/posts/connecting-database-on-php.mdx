# PHP Database Connection and Operations

## Part 1: Connecting to the Database

```php
$servername = "localhost"; // This is like your house's address
$username = "username";    // This is your name
$password = "password";    // This is your secret knock
$dbname = "QT_2081";      // This is the name of your toy box

// Let's try to connect! It's like knocking on the door
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Did we connect okay?
if ($conn->connect_error) {
  die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error); // Oh no! Door's locked!
}

echo "Connected successfully"; // Yay! We're inside!
```

**Explanation**  
Imagine your computer is a house (`$servername = "localhost"`).  
To get in, you need a name (`$username`), a password (`$password`), and the name of the place inside, like your toy box (`$dbname = "QT_2081"`).  
This code tries to open the door. If it works, you're in! If not, it'll tell you the door is locked.

## Part 2: Creating the "Student" Table

```php
// First, let's choose the toy box (database)
$conn->select_db($dbname);

// Now, let's make a new space in the toy box for students!
$sql = "CREATE TABLE Student (
  StdId INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  StdName VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  Gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
)";

// Did we make the space okay?
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
  echo "Table Student created successfully"; // Hooray! New space created!
} else {
  echo "Error creating table: " . $conn->error; // Oh no! Couldn't make the space!
}
```

**Explanation**  
First, we pick the toy box (`$conn->select_db($dbname)`).  
Then, we create a special spot inside for "Student" toys (`$sql`).  
Each student toy has:
- A number (`StdId`)
- A name (`StdName`)
- Gender (`Gender`)  
If we make the spot okay, we're happy! If not, we ask for help.

## Part 3: Adding Students to the Table

```php
// Now, let's add some student toys!
$sql = "INSERT INTO Student (StdName, Gender) VALUES
('Alice', 'Female'),
('Bob', 'Male')";

// Did we add them okay?
if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
  echo "New records created successfully"; // Yay! Toys added!
} else {
  echo "Error: " . $sql . "<br>" . $conn->error; // Oh no! Something went wrong!
}

// All done! Let's close the toy box.
$conn->close();
```

**Explanation**  
Now we put some student toys into the spot we made (`$sql`).  
We put Alice (who is a girl) and Bob (who is a boy).  
If we put them in okay, we're happy! If not, we ask for help.  
Finally, we close the toy box (`$conn->close()`). All done!

## Complete Code Example

```php
<?php
// Database connection settings
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "QT_2081";

// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected to database successfully!<br>";

// Create Student table
$sql = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Student (
    StdId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StdName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
)";

if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
    echo "Student table created successfully!<br>";
} else {
    echo "Error creating table: " . $conn->error . "<br>";
}

// Insert student records
$students = [
    [1, 'John Doe', 'Male'],
    [2, 'Jane Smith', 'Female']
];

foreach ($students as $student) {
    $sql = "INSERT INTO Student (StdId, StdName, Gender) 
            VALUES ($student[0], '$student[1]', '$student[2]')";
    
    if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE) {
        echo "Student {$student[0]} inserted!<br>";
    } else {
        echo "Error inserting record: " . $conn->error . "<br>";
    }
}

// Close connection
$conn->close();
?>
```
**Conclusion**
Now you know how to connect to a database using PHP, create a table, and add records!
This is a simple way to manage your toys (data) in a box (database).
